                        The Sinister Six are a group of supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, mainly those featuring Spider-Man. The members are drawn from the character's list of enemies, with the original members forming the team in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1 (October 1964). Led by Doctor Octopus (introduced in issue #3), the team in its premiere followed swiftly the very early appearances of many of the most enduring members of Spider-Man's rogue's gallery: Vulture (issue #2), Sandman (issue #4), Electro (issue #9), Mysterio (issue #13), and Kraven the Hunter (issue #15). While Doctor Octopus has generally remained its leader, the Sinister Six has had multiple variations of composition.
                        The team has been adapted into various forms of media, mainly in animated series and video games. A film based on the team is in development as part of Sony's Spider-Man Universe.

                    <div class="dataSwitcher" id="resumeData">S.H.I.E.L.D. is a fictional espionage, special law enforcement, and counter-terrorism government agency appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.[1] Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, this agency first appeared in Strange Tales #135 (August 1965), and often deals with paranormal activity and superhuman threats to international security.

                        The acronym originally stood for Supreme Headquarters, International Espionage and Law-Enforcement Division.[2] It was changed in 1991 to Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate. Within the various films set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as multiple animated and live-action television series, the backronym stands for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.[3]
                        
                        The organization has heavily appeared in media adaptations as well as films and shows that take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</div>
